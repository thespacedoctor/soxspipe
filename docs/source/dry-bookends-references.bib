These 25 brief devotional readings from John Piper begin on December 1 and carry us to Christmas Day. Our prayer is that God would use these readings to deepen and sweeten your adoration of Jesus this December and keep him as the center and greatest treasure of your Christmas season.

What can the call to discipleship, the adherence to the word of Jesus, mean today to the businessman, the soldier, the laborer, or the government worker? What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between "cheap grace" and "costly grace." "Cheap grace," Bonhoeffer wrote, "is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life." The Cost of Discipleship is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.}, }@Article{heylighen2008,author = {Heylighen, F and Vidal, C}, title = {Getting things done: the science behind stress-free productivity}, journal = {Long Range Planning}, year = {2008}, }@Incollection{willard2009i,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 09 A Curriculum for Christlikeness}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Incollection{willard2009d,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 03 What Jesus Knew}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Incollection{willard2009h,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 08 On Being A Disciple Or Student Of Jesus}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Incollection{willard2009f,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 05 The Rightness Of The Kingdom Heart}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Incollection{willard2009c,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 02 Gospels Of Sin Management}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Book{willard2009,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy}, pages = {448}, publisher = {Harper Collins}, year = {2009}, abstract = {The Divine Conspiracy has revolutionized how we think about the true meaning of discipleship.

Winsome, accessible, and carefully researched, every page is brought to life by the author's clear love for Scripture and deep, persistent faith. With this book, Matthew Vines emerges as one of my generation's most important Christian leaders, not only on matters of sexuality but also on what it means to follow Jesus with wisdom, humility, and grace. Prepare to be challenged and enlightened, provoked and inspired. Read with an open heart and mind, and you are bound to be changed.'' --- Rachel Held Evans, author of A Year of Biblical Womanhood and Faith Unraveled As a young Christian man, Matthew Vines harbored the same basic hopes of most young people: to someday share his life with someone, to build a family of his own, to give and receive love. But when he realized he was gay, those hopes were called into question. The Bible, he'd been taught, condemned gay relationships. Feeling the tension between his understanding of the Bible and the reality of his same-sex orientation, Vines devoted years of intensive research into what the Bible says about homosexuality. With care and precision, Vines asked questions such as: {\bullet} Do biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not? {\bullet} How should we apply the teachings of Jesus to the gay debate? {\bullet} What does the story of Sodom and Gomorrah really say about human relationships? {\bullet} Can celibacy be a calling when it is mandated, not chosen? {\bullet} What did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations? Unique in its affirmation of both an orthodox faith and sexual diversity, God and the Gay Christian is likely to spark heated debate, sincere soul search­ing, even widespread cultural change.

What was there before it? What will the future bring? And finally, why is there something rather than nothing?'' One of the few prominent scientists today to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, Krauss describes the staggeringly beautiful experimental observations and mind-bending new theories that demonstrate not only can something arise from nothing, something will always arise from nothing. With a new preface about the significance of the discovery of the Higgs particle, A Universe from Nothing uses Krauss's characteristic wry humor and wonderfully clear explanations to take us back to the beginning of the beginning, presenting the most recent evidence for how our universe evolved---and the implications for how it's going to end. Provocative, challenging, and delightfully readable, this is a game-changing look at the most basic underpinning of existence and a powerful antidote to outmoded philosophical, religious, and scientific thinking.}, }@Incollection{willard2009b,author = {Willard, Dallas}, title = {The Divine Conspiracy Ch 01 Entering The Eternal Kind Of Life Now}, booktitle = {The Divine Conspiracy}, year = {2009}, }@Book{bono2005,author = {Bono and Assayas, Michka}, title = {Bono on Bono}, pages = {323}, year = {2005}, abstract = {Over the past twenty five years Bono, and his band U2, have sold a staggering 130 million albums and collected 14 Grammys.

Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, "we have no theory." Frankfurt, one of the world's most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all. Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner's capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.}, keywords = {Philosophy},}@Book{keller2016,author = {Keller, Timothy}, title = {Hidden Christmas}, pages = {160}, publisher = {Hachette UK}, year = {2016}, abstract = {The New Testament begins not with a dramatic narrative or lofty poetry but with a genealogy.

Newport, who graduated from Dartmouth College (Phi Beta Kappa) and earned a PhD. from MIT, contends that trying to find what drives us, instead of focusing on areas in which we naturally excel, is ultimately harmful and frustrating to job seekers. The title is a direct quote from comedian Steve Martin who, when once asked why he was successful in his career, immediately replied: "Be so good they can't ignore you" and that's the main basis for Newport's book. Skill and ability trump passion. Inspired by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs' famous Stanford University commencement speech in which Jobs urges idealistic grads to chase their dreams, Newport takes issue with that advice, claiming that not only is thsi advice Pollyannish, but that Jobs himself never followed his own advice. From there, Newport presents compelling scientific and contemporary case study evidence that the key to one's career success is to find out what you do well, where you have built up your 'career capital,' and then to put all of your efforts into that direction.}, }@Article{brahm2017,author = {Brahm, Rafael and Jord{\'a}n, Andr{\'e}s and Espinoza, N{\'e}stor}, title = {{CERES}: A Set of Automated Routines for Echelle Spectra}, journal = {Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific}, volume = {129}, number = {973}, pages = {034002}, year = {2017}, }@Book{forster1992,author = {Forster, Edward Morgan}, title = {A Room with a View}, pages = {209}, year = {1992}, abstract = {Set partly in Florence, partly in the Surrey hills, A ROOM WITH A VIEW depicts the struggle for the soul of its enchanting heroine, Lucy Honeychuch.

An up-and-coming expert in the burgeoning field of mental illness is engaged by a group of reformers and spiritualists who seek a pardon for Grace.

Our gut is almost as important to us as our brain or our heart, yet we know very little about how it works. In Gut, Giulia Enders shows that rather than the utilitarian and --- let's be honest --- somewhat embarrassing body part we imagine it to be, it is one of the most complex, important, and even miraculous parts of our anatomy. And scientists are only just discovering quite how much it has to offer; new research shows that gut bacteria can play a role in everything from obesity and allergies to Alzheimer's. Beginning with the personal experience of illness that inspired her research, and going on to explain everything from the basics of nutrient absorption to the latest science linking bowel bacteria with depression, Enders has written an entertaining, informative health handbook. Gut definitely shows that we can all benefit from getting to know the wondrous world of our inner workings. In this charming book, young scientist Giulia Enders takes us on a fascinating tour of our insides. Her message is simple --- if we treat our gut well, it will treat us well in return. But how do we do that? And why do we need to? Find out in this surprising, and surprisingly funny, exploration of the least understood of our organs.

Our lives are driven by a fact that most of us can't name and don't understand. It defines who our friends and lovers are, which careers we choose, and whether we blush when we're embarrassed. That fact is whether we're an introvert or an extrovert. The most fundamental dimension of personality, at least a third of us are introverts, and yet shyness, sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as a negative. Some of the world's most talented people are introverts - without them we wouldn't have the Apple computer, the theory of relativity and Van Gogh's sunflowers. In Quiet, Susan Cain shows how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts while giving them the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with real stories, whether an introvert or extrovert, this book will change how you see human beings for good. ***** 'I can't get Quiet out of my head. It is an important book - so persuasive and timely and heartfelt it should inevitably effect change in schools and offices' Jon Ronson, The Guardian 'Susan Cain's Quiet has sparked a quiet revolution . . . Perhaps rather than sitting back and asking people to speak up, managers and company leaders might lean forward and listen' Megan Walsh, The Times 'Maybe the extrovert ideal is no longer as powerful as it was; perhaps it is time we all stopped to listen to the still, small voice of calm' Daisy Goodwin, The Sunday Times}, keywords = {Self-Help},}@Article{jimenez2017,author = {Jim{\'e}nez, RC and Kuzak, M and Alhamdoosh, M et al.}, title = {Four simple recommendations to encourage best practices in research software.}, journal = {F1000Res}, volume = {6}, pages = {ELIXIR--876}, year = {2017}, }@Article{dey2019,author = {Dey, Arjun and Schlegel, David J. and Lang, Dustin et al.}, title = {Overview of the {DESI} Legacy Imaging Surveys}, journal = {The Astronomical Journal}, volume = {157}, number = {5}, pages = {168}, year = {2019}, }@Article{murphy2007,author = {Murphy, M.
