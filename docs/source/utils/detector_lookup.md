## Detector Lookup - COMPLETED

The purpose of the [detector_lookup](../_api/soxspipe.commonutils.detector_lookup.html) utility is to act as reference in the code for the various characteristics of the soxs detectors. 

When initiated [detector_lookup](../_api/soxspipe.commonutils.detector_lookup.html) reads the detector characteristics from a [Detector Parameters](../files/detector_parameters.md) file and can later serve these parameters to the soxspipe code when requested.
